Brown and Jakob Kunz would develop the photoelectric photometer which would use electricity to help simplify this process. \n \n ii. Stebbins credited his wife as the driving force for this idea. When they were first married she would sometimes go to the observatory with him to help him get his work done faster so they could spend more time together. He told her one day they would be able to do this much faster with electricity and from then on she encouraged him to discover this method. A couple of months later he went to a physics open house where F.C. Brown had a demonstration of a selenium cell. Stebbins worked with Brown to create a selenium cell photometer.\n \n iii. While the selenium cell photometer helped discover five new eclipsing binary stars, Stebbins felt it was not strong enough. He was introduced to Jakob Kunz, who had been working to improve photoelectric cells. They collaborated to create and continually refine the photoelectric photometer. This development allowed for stebbins to better research variable stars and he was able to measure diameters and masses more accurately than any other instrument had been able to provide up to that point.",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

These ethnographies (ancient travelogues) look at differences in consumption, something that is more relevant now as we look to different things to eat in the wake of a changing climate. Bosak-Schroder thinks that these ethnographies can help current leaders find ways to view and fix climate change issues. She also focuses on how people are educated about climate issues, which is another way that these ancient words can help influence modern thinking.",

After this initial research, Rose moved on to human diets, feeding male graduate students with the essential amino acids.

In 2018, Tabb and her team obtained funding from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to create an advisory board to engage local people. The IDEA coalition quickly gained ground, hosting a national symposium in 2019, a mental-health film screening in both 2018 and 2019, and many other meetings. By this past spring (2020), the coalition received four funding awards to maintain their research, which they do along with students, faculty, and patients. The IDEA Coalition expanded to rural areas to help every population with perinatal depression.",

Prior to the Holland Tunnel, tunnels were generally smaller in scope and did not have many issues in ventilation. The Holland Tunnel, however, was longer and needed new ventilation. The issue was passed to researchers from the University of Illinois. Yale, and the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The University of Illinois came up with a new design of 84 fans in the tunnel, with 42 providing fresh air and 42 expelling the harmful carbon dioxide, allowing the air supply to be replenished every 1.6 minutes. This system was tested in 1949 when a tanker truck carrying carbon disulfide exploded. The ventilation system allowed the tunnel to reopen after 56 hours after the tunnel had been exposed to extreme temperatures and harmful gases.",

Newmark, a research professor in Civil Engineering, was a prominent engineer in the 1940s to the 1960s, when he formed the National Academy of Engineering in 1964. His main focus was analyzing structural components and calculating the stresses in the soil underneath foundations of buildings. His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

The Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies was formed in 2009 and was built on the collaboration between University scholars and Brazilian scholars in economics, agriculture, literature, and history.  This work was augmented by the library's Brazilian collection, which has 103,000 volumes written in Portuguese. This center offers fellowships to both University and Brazilian students for further study for both undergraduates and graduates. This Institute, led by Professor Love, has pushed for research and collaboration between American and Brazilian scholars.",

Archaea were able to live both in extreme habitats as well as in soil, marshes, and overall, the human body. Woese's discovery found the third category of life beyond prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Woese found this third category by viewing biology through the eyes of a chemist. He found out how to trace the sequence of a molecule in prokaryotes by using ribosomal RNA. The first archaea that was found was the methanogen. Despite the advancements in science, Woese and his team were initially met with resistance when they published their paper in 1977. However, their findings have found their way into science textbooks and into the science curriculum.",

He developed the GRIT strategy (Graduated Reciprocation in Tension Reduction) as a new method of how to reduce tensions through communication and not necessarily negotiations. In his process, two countries make a plan for open communication and reciprocation with a particular focus on the arms race and disarmament. This process was used in what Osgood called the 'Kennedy Experiment' with the Cuban MIssile Crisis and was also used later by Jimmy Carter. Along with his work on GRIT, he alsdo served as the president of the American Psychological Association and published many articles on the future of the nation with regards to the arms race.",

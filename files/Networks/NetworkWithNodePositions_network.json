Research at the plots was vital for better understand crop rotation. It has also been used to study the long-term effects of fertilizers and effects of synthetic and natural fertilizers. The plots were named after George Morrow, Dean of the College of Agriculture (1877-1894) in honor of the work he did for the college, especially raising enrollment numbers and bringing research to farmers across the state. Research on the plots continues today and is important as we learn more about how climate change affects crops. ",

A multidisciplinary team at the University of Illinois was the first to conduct outdoor research on the effects of increased carbon dioxide on crops in a project called the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE). Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, large octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

In the early years of the university, enrollment of farmers was low. The university needed a solution to help farmers learn about the innovative research that could them in their endeavors. Charles F. Mills of the Illinois State Board of Agriculture, suggested the idea of Farmer's Institutes where faculty from the university would go out to the farmers to share their knowledge. This started with researchers going to the counties across the state and having informal discussions with the residents. It soon grew and the university was able to host annual gatherings where farmers would come to the university, attend several lectures on practical farming related issues and then have discussion. Some of the topics included building rural roads, supplies of vegetables in the winter and dairy management to name a few.",

The synthetic polymers he developed were used by astronauts and firemen due to its resistance to temperatures up to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. The polybenzimidazoles he created were the first man-made fibers produced commercially in the 1980s.

          "nodeDescription": "Innovative technology is often exciting and many may want to try and use these innovations as much as possible. Sometimes though, it pays to think about the costs of the technology and if other methods or technology would achieve the same goal. Dr. Ujjal Kumar Mukherjee, a professor of business administration, studies when robot-assisted surgeries are most cost efficient to use and achieve positive health outcomes for the patients. His research with collaborators from the University of Minnesota, shows that it is best when hospitals have higher level policies for when this technology should be used and who should use it. He has helped to show that using robot-assisted surgeries, instead of manual laparoscopic surgery for hysterectomy surgeries, is best when the disease condition of a patient is severe.  His research also noted having a smaller pool of surgeons learning this technique at one time, leads to better outcomes for the patients and is more cost efficient when using this expensive technology. The smaller pool of surgeons allows for them to complete the surgery more and become more effective in the procedure. These types of studies are important for making sure healthcare settings are effective and are able to spend money efficiently. ",

In his process, two countries make a plan for open communication and reciprocation with a particular focus on the arms race and disarmament. This process was used in what Osgood called the \"Kennedy Experiment\" with the Cuban MIssile Crisis and was also used later by Jimmy Carter. Along with his work on GRIT, he also served as the president of the American Psychological Association and published many articles on the future of the nation with regards to the arms race.",

Dr. Takayama used these linear models to predict future costs of products that would be traded internationally, such as wheat. This was used generally to see if prices would likely increase or decrease based on the projected supply (including taking into account any stock piles) and demand.

Other researchers continue to use this method to explore new areas of research and expand our knowledge. Dr. Kiel Christianson works in this area and has helped many students conduct research with eye-tracking research.

He felt that having natural and social sciences taught how to evaluate what to believe and the aesthetic education taught whom to believe. Aesthetic education helped students learn what a culture values (such as courage and honesty) and how it has changed overtime, therefore it would be useful to applying scientific principles. This educational theory greatly influenced the curriculum of schools and we still today have a balance of scientific and humanities subjects. ",

His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

For example the moving agent may make the camera move so that it follows the head, hands or other movements.

PAC-1 is an abbreviation for procaspase-activating compound and was discovered in Hergenrother's lab when he was studying 20,000 compounds to see their ability to turn on an enzyme that can selectively kill cancer cells. Hergenrother and Fan work together to test the effectiveness of PAC-1 through animal trials and now human trials.  Along with Hergenrother and Fan, one of the main researchers was a daschund with a brain tumor named Pretzel, who acted as one of the test dogs, with success. Pretzel, after going through treatment with PAC-1 and standard cancer treatment, had her tumor shrunk and her life expectancy extended. Hergenrother and Fan are continuing with trials today to make this an effective treatment.",

The dancers go at their own pace and utilize the space in ways that their ability can afford them to. Regardless of their range of motion, there is a joyful mood surrounding the class, as it creates a space for people to embrace the music and temporarily step away from Parkinson's and to promote both physical and mental health habits.

Labor and Employment Relations professors YoungAh Park and Yihao Liu, along with graduate student Lucille Headrick studies how workers manage these boundaries and what tactics can lead to lower stress. In 2017 they surveyed teachers to find how many create a boundary related to email and what other influences in the school environment enable teachers to have a clearer boundary between work and life. Their findings showed that about 50% of the teachers surveyed had email notifications on their phones and on weeks when they received more emails after hours, they had higher instances of thinking about the negative events that had happened at their jobs and insomnia. They also found that  principles (or supervisors) who communicate their own work-home boundaries will lead to more teachers implementing these boundaries. The final factor they examined were parents' expectations, and found what teachers' perceived parents (or clients) expectations to be played an important role on being able to separate these boundaries. Their conclusions that limiting technology that can break these boundaries and setting clear expectations of when they will work to supervisors and clients can help individuals to lower their work related stress.

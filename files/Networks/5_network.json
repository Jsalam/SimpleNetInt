PAC1-! is an abbreviation for procaspase-activating compound and was discovered in Hergenrother's lab when he was studying 20,000 compounds to see their ability to turn on an enzyme that can selectively kill cancer cells. Along with Hergenrother and Fan, one of the main researchers was a daschund with a brain tumor named Pretzel, who acted as one of the test dogs, with success. Pretzel, after going through treatment with PAC-1 and standard cancer treatment, had her tumor shrunk and her life expectancy extended. Hergenrother and Fan are continuing with trials today to make this an effective treatment.",

They record a person's movements and are able to show an abstract skeleton (dots and lines) of the movements. They examine how the camera and the movements of the body influence each other. For example the moving agent may make the camera move so that it follows the head, hands or other movements. The lab has also expanded to create artistic pieces of work, use Laban Movement Studies methods, analyze dance numbers from cinema and continues to expand its scope of research. ",

In 2017 they surveyed teachers to find how many create a boundary related to email and what other influences in the school environment enable teacher's to have a clearer boundary between work and life. Their findings showed that about 50% of the teachers surveyed had email notifications on their phones and on weeks when they received more emails after hours, they had higher instances of thinking about the negative events that had happened at their jobs and insomnia. They also found that  principles (or supervisors) who communicate their own work-home boundaries will lead to more teachers implementing these boundaries. The final factor they examined were parents' expectations, and found what teachers' perceived parents (or clients) expectations to be played an important role on being able to separate these boundaries. Their conclusions that limiting technology that can break these boundaries and setting clear expectations of when they will work to supervisors and clients can help individuals to lower their work related stress. Their findings are important to understand how individuals can create a better boundary and allow for better stress management as well as how the school or company can lessen its workers stress levels.

She, along with multiple collaborators has tested the effectiveness of the Special Friends curriculumn in several regards. The Special Friends curriculum has teachers read books that have characters with disabilities and then have students complete a small group activity together. The book often emphasizes the similiarities between children with and without disabilities. Her research has shown that implementing this curriculum increased children's cooperativeness and responsibility as well as increasing emphathy for peers who were different from the child compared to those in a similar curriculum focused on science instead of disabilities. Her next study of this curriculum looked at if friendships increased for students of disabilities. As can happen with innovative research, her and her collaborators found that this program did not increase close friendships, but the science curriculum suprisingly did. The researchers hypothesize this is because the small groups were structured differently (one was free play and the other all students were working towards a goal). This presented a new challenge to research, do kids who have not developed play skills have a harder time making close friends, and can teachers help them by encouraging ways for students to learn those skills?",

From 1884 to 1921, Stephen Forbes was a professor in zoology and entomology who mostly studied insects, birds, fish and crustaceans. His major area of focus was the interactions between species and how these interactions affected the agricultural industry. His publications were some of the earliest work in what is now known as the field of ecology and he is considered as one of the founders of the formal field. Looking at how animals and humans have an impact on each other’s environments, habits, and culture is also an important part of climate change research currently taking place.",

This is compared to dominion beliefs, which advocate for the idea that God gives humans free reign. Dominion beliefs are linked tot lower concerncocnern for climate change. Shin conducted this research through having different groups read different articles including: Bible passages (either stewardship or dominion) or a control article.

She argues that combating climate change is linked to individual perceptions of climate issues as opposed to societal views , which is why it is important to look at how individuals come to their views towards climate change. Based on her research, Deryugina found that people often didn't show a sense of urgency unless there were significant changes. People often paid more attention to local weather in forming their views of climate change and often times forget about larger occurrences like heat waves. These views impact how public policy is enacted and the timeline it is enacted in.",

Previous studies have grown crops inside greenhouses to study what the changes in atmosphere may entail. For SoyFACE, Llarge octagonal plots are established with the ability to release higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone on any side of the plot. This helps account for wind carrying the gases across the plot. This innovative way allows for crops to be grown with typical conditions but with future atmospheric conditions.",

Dr. Ravi Mehta, a professor of business administration at Illinois and an expert in product development and marketing, questioned what could improve the process for creating products. His research showed that thinking about end users feelings made designers more emphathetic which increased creativity in finding solutions for product design. He and his collaborators did several experiments where people had to create a new product using either a \"feelings-imagination approach\", where creators thought of end users feelings, or an \"object-imagination\" approach, which focuses more on the utility of an object. They found the feelings approach led to more creativity. Dr. Mehta suggests this will be especially useful for companies who are crowdsourcing new ideas and the creators do not have as much experience in product design. ",

She initially could only be considered an instructor because her husban was also a professor in the Economics Department and the University had strict nepotism rules that prevented spouses from working in the same department when they started working at the university in the 1950. One of Ferber's earliest professional works was examining the pay gap between male and female professors, and she used her home institution for the study. Her work allowed other female faculty at the University of Illinois to receive pay raises. She continued to examine how gender differences impacted pay, wealth accumulation and more, and helped establish the International Association for Feminist Economics.",

Sometimes though, it pays to think about the costs of the technology and if other methods or technology would achieve the same goal. Dr. Ujjal Kumar Mukherjee, a professor of business administration, studies when robot-assisted surgeries are most cost efficient to use and achieve positive health outcomes for the patients. His research with collaborators from the University of Minnesota, shows that it is best when hospitals have higher level policies for when this technology should be used and who should use it. He has helped to show that using robot-assisted surgeries, instead of manual laparascopic surgery for hysterectomy surgeries, is best when the disease condition of a patient is severe and that having a smaller pool of surgeons learning this technique at one time, leads to better outcomes for the patients and is more cost effienct when using this expensive technology. The smaller pool of surgeons allows for them to complete the surgery more and become more effective in the procedure. These types of studies are important for making sure healthcare settings are effective and are able to spend money effiently ",

Charles F. Mills of the Illinois State Board of Agriculture, suggested the idea of Farmer's Institutes where faculty from the university would go out to the farmers to share their knowledge. This started with researchers going to the counties across the state and having informal discussions with the residents. It soon grew and the university was able to host annual gatherings where farmers would come to the university, attend several lectures on practical farming related issues and then have discussion. Some of the topics included building rural roads, supplies of vegetables in the winter and dairy management to name a few.",

It also focuses on applications for enabling creative work in agriculture, business, geology, history, etc. The CyberGIS (and by extension, ROGER) was highly interdisciplinary and focused on spreading knowledge beyond the University's limits.",

His particular focus in the 1960s-1980s was diffusing tensions between countries, specifically the United States and the Soviet Union. He developed the GRIT strategy (Graduated Reciprocation in Tension Reduction) as a new method of how to reduce tensions through communication and not necessarily negotiations. In his process, two countries make a plan for open communication and reciprocation with a particular focus on the arms race and disarmament. This process was used in what Osgood called the \"Kennedy Experiment\" with the Cuban MIssile Crisis and was also used later by Jimmy Carter. Along with his work on GRIT, he alsdo served as the president of the American Psychological Association and published many articles on the future of the nation with regards to the arms race.",

George McConkie worked on developing a new method to study reading by using computers to help track eye movements. He started this work at Cornell but moved to the University of Illinois in 1979 to the Educational Psychology department. He was one of the first researchers to develop this method for studying reading. Some examples of his work included examining how large of a fixed area eyes had when reading and how eyes move while looking at photos. Other researchers continue to use this method to explore new areas of research and expand our knowledge. Dr. Kiel Christianson works in this area and has helped many students conduct research with eye-tracking research. Mallory Stites, a graduate student worked on examining if people's reading speeds changed when adverbs such as quickly or slowly described how text was said. They were able to show that the speed of reading does change and were able to term the phenonmenon as \"Auditory Perceptual simulation\". ",

Linear models help to solve complex problems and can be used to look at supply and demand. Their model had parameters and variables that researchers often defined from looking at historical data to help run these spatial-temporal equilibrium models. Dr. Takayama used these linear models to predict future costs of products that would be traded internationally, such as wheat. This was used generally to see if prices would likely increase or decrease based on the projected supply (including taking into account any stock piles) and demand. Other researchers also used this model and it proved to be a useful tool. ",

This early work in a broom closet eventually became the basis for the curriculum in the now called Department of Speech and Hearing Science within the School of Applied Health Sciences.

This act allowed the president to change tarrifs and Dr. Beckett examined if it was successful. Her conclusions that it did help trade, but that it was not the lone factor and other factors may have played a more significant role was well received. She was also praised for the amount of information she had compiled and made available through her work. She continued her career of writing about the history of international economics and was widely recognized as an expert. She was even in the Who's Who of American Women in 1967 in recognition of the influence her works had on the field of economics. ",

                    "nodeDescription": "Nathan M. Newmark, a research professor in Civil Engineering, was a prominent engineer in the 1940s to the 1960s, when he formed the National Academy of Engineering in 1964. His main focus was analyzing structural components and calculating the stresses in the soil underneath foundations of buildings. His research looked at brittle and fatigue failure of buildings, adding his expertise to the building of bridges and floor slabs in buildings to help fight against earthquakes, impact, and any wear and tear to the building structure. His research led many different companies and people to seek his advice, with the Latino Americana Tower in Mexico City being one of his success stories. His work on the tower led to it withstanding two earthquakes in 1957 and 1985. His work on global projects coincided with his being head of the Civil Engineering department, a position he held until 1973.",

Dr. Yuqian Xu. a business adminstration professor, looked at redistributing some of the top earners money for a crowdsource delivery service in China and found that when underpaid workers had opportunity to earn more they increased their productivity. Dr. Xu found that these incentives increased workers' service capacity between 14 and 31 percent with little affect to the workers who were in the top 1%, 3% and 5% earnings. Finding new ways to study the effectiveness of these models and ensure that supply of workers is available to meet the demands of the consumers will continue to be important as people choose to have this model of employment.

He helped develop the foundations of aesthetic education, emphasizing that humanities and arts played an important role in education for a democratic society. Broudy's theory evolved from the arts and humanities helping to teach moral values to these subjects teaching students whom to believe, especially when referring to those in positions to make decisions for a group, town or nation. He felt that having natural and social sciences taught what how to evaluate what to believe and the aesthetic education taught whom to believe. Aesthetic education helped students learn what a culture values (such as courage and honesty) and how it has changed overtime, therefore it would be useful to applying scientific principles. This educational theory greatly influenced the curriculum of schools and we still today have a balance of scientific and humanties subjects. ",

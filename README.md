# SimpleNetInt
Simple NetInt is a JavaScript version of NetInt, a Java-based node-link visualization prototype designed to support the visual discovery of patterns across large dataset by displaying disjoint clusters of vertices that could be filtered, zoomed in or drilled down interactively. The visualization strategy used in Simple NetInt is to place clustered nodes in independent 3D spaces and draw links between nodes across multiple spaces. The result is a simple graphic user interface that enables visual depth as an intuitive dimension for data exploration.

The final goal of this project is to develop an augmented reality visualization of networks to be used in the field of digital humanities. This proof of concept shows that scholars in the humanities come across datasets with different dimensional systems that might not be compatible across them. For instance, a timeline of scholarly publications may encompass 10 or 15 years, but the content of what is been discussed in that body of work may encompass centuries of history. Therefore, these two different temporal dimensions need to be represented in such a way that helps scholars in their interpretations. I believe that an immersive visualization may drive new questions for researchers or convey new findings to the public.

Simple NetInt is a simple but robust JavaScript sketchpad derived from NetInt, a Java-based node-link network visualization library.  The library is not a desktop application but a collection of prewritten functions that users can use to optimize visualization tasks. It is meant to be integrated into web applications so users can share their work on the Internet and invite remote collaborators to extend the dataset and rearrange visual elements.  As a stand-alone sketchpad, it has a simple graphical interface with essential functionality; but users can extend it, as exemplified in the case studies. The libraryâ€™s visualization strategy is to draw threads of linked nodes from information stored in a database. Each data point is represented by a circular node encompassing as many colored connectors as relational attributes of the data point. The links are colored bezier curves that associate nodes by shared relational attributes or ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10836823/165643623-2d6f2f06-da79-4c63-87be-638438cf0375.png)
